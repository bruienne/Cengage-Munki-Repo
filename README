This repository contains the non-private parts of the Cengage Learning Munki manifests, catalogs and pkgsinfo files as used to distribute updates to the user base in Farmington Hills, MI.

All files contained within are currently used in a testing-only capacity and under a lot of change. That said, implementation has been smooth and we have experienced few problems while managing our group of pilot Macs.

For questions please contact Pepijn Bruienne at pepijn.bruienne@cengage.com

Thank you.
